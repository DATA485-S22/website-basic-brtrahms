# A Brief Introduction To Adversarial Networks

![](painter.jpg)

\

Most people have seen deep fakes and AI generated images online but people often don't know the underlying technology behind it. For my senior Capstone, I am conducting a research project which uses Adversarial Networks and found this to be a very cool realm of machine learning.

\

The basic design of a Adversarial system include two different networks, the generator and the discriminator. The Generator will simply take in a random seed as an input and use that number to calculate pixel values. The Discriminator will be paired with a training set which is a mix of real images and generated images. It will then train over this set and classify them as either real or fake. Both networks will then be trained on the accuracy of the discriminator but in opposite directions. While the discriminator will try to maximize it's accuracy, the generator will try to minimize it by generating images that the discriminator will think its real. This process has been used and has produce some facinating results in the machine learning sphere.

# Tidy Models Tutorial

In this tutorial I will walk you through how to fit a linear model to a data set using the tidy models package. In this tutorial I will be using a CalCOFI data set of oceanic measurements of temperature in Celsius and depth in Meters. Here we will see what the relationship between temperature and depth shallower than 500 meters.
\

## Libraries 

```{r, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```
\

## Step 1 - Import and Setup Dataset

Our first step will be to import CalCOFI data and filter for our desired depth, done by the R code below.
```{r}
#Base Dataset
CalCOFI <- read.csv("CalCOFI.csv")

# Depth lower than 500 filtered out
CalCOFI <- CalCOFI %>%
filter(Depthm < 500)
```
\

## Step 2 - Initial Visualization

Before we begin modeling, we will want to see if linear modeling is applicable in this case. We can do this by some data visualization with a linear trend line, done by the R code below.
```{r, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}

CalCOFI %>%
ggplot(aes(Depthm, T_degC)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
\
Based on the graph above, the fit can be roughly described as linear and makes linear regression applicable.
\

## Step 3 - Build and Fit Model

Now we can Build and fit out model to our data, done by the R code below.
```{r}
# Build
model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

# Fit
fit <- model %>%
  fit(T_degC~Depthm, data = CalCOFI)
```
\

## Step 4 - Interpretation

Our last step is to interpret the model we have fit. So to view our coefficients, see R code below.
```{r}
tidy(fit)
```
From this we can see an association of depth to temperature of -0.0239. This means that on average, for every single meter increase of depth would result a decrease in temperature of 0.0239 Celsius.
